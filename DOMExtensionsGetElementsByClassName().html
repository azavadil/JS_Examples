		getElementsByClassName()
		@param1: 		a string containing one or more class names
		return val:		NodeList containing all elements that have all of 			
						the specified classes applied. 
		
		Available on the document object and HTML elements
		
		When this method is called it will return only elements in the subtree
		of the root from which it was called. Calling getElementsByClassName() 
		on document always returns all elements with matching class names, 
		whereas calling it on an element will return only descendant elements. 
		
		This mehtod is useful for attaching events to classes of elements rather
		than using IDs or tage names.
