  <!-- 	Forms: common form-field properties 
		
		With the exception of the <fieldset> element, all form fields share a 
		set of properties. Since the <input> type represents many form fields
		some properties are used only with certain types, whereas others are 
		used regardless of the field type. Common form-field properties
		
		disabled: 		boolean indicating if the form field is disabled
		form: 			a pointer to the form that the field belongs to (read only)
		name:			the name of the form
		readOnly: 		boolean indicating if the field is read only 
		tabIndex:		Indicates the tab order for the field
		type: 			the type of the field: "checkbox", "radio"
		value: 			the value of the field that will be submitted to the 
						server. For file-input fields this property is read-only
						and simply contains the file's path on the computer
	
		With the exception of the form property, JavaScript can change all the 
		other properties dynamically.

	/** 
	 * Note: 
	 * -----
	 * The ability to change form-field properties dynamically allows you to 
	 * change the form at any time. A common prolem with web forms is users' 
	 * tendency to click the submit button twice. A common solution to this 
	 * problem is to disable the submit button once it's been clicked, 
	 * which is possible by listening for the submit event and disabling 
	 * the submit button when it occurs
