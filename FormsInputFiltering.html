  <!-- 	Input filtering 
  
		Certain types of input require specific characters (e.g. phone number must be
		numeric). The keypress event is responsible for inserting characters into a
		text box. Characters can be blocked by preventing this event's default
		behavoir. 
		
		For example the following code blocks all key presses
		
		EventUtil.addHandler(txtbox,"keypress", function(event){
			event = EventUtil.getEvent(event); 
			EventUtil.preventDefault(event); 
		}); 

		
  --> 
		
		

  <div id="content">
	<form> 
		<input id="textbox1" type="text" size="25" maxlength="50" value="initial value">
	
		<textarea rows="25" cols="5">intial value</textarea> 
	</form> 
  </div> 

  <script type="text/javascript" src="F:\js\EventUtil.js"></script>

	 /** 
	  * Note: 
	  * -----
	  * the character code is retrieve using EventUtil.getCharCode() for 
	  * cross-browser compatibility. The character code is converted to a 
	  * string using String.fromCharCode(), and the result is tested against
	  * the regular expression /\d/, which matches all numeric characters. 
	  * If that test fails, then the event is blocked using EventUtil.preventDefault()
	  *
	  *	
	  *	EventUtil.addHandler(txtbox,"keypress", function(event){
	  *	  event = EventUtil.getEvent(event); 
	  *	  var target = EventUtil.getTarget(event); 
	  *	  var charCode = EventUtil.getCharCode(event); 
	  *
	  *		if(!/\d/.test(String.fromCharCode(charCode))){
	  *			EventUtil.preventDefault(event);

	  /** 
	  * Note: 
	  * -----
	  * Even though the keypress event should be fired only when a character  
	  * key is pressed some browsers fire it for other keys as well. Firefox 
	  * and Safari<=3.1 fire keypress for keys like up, down, Backspace, and Delete. 
	  * This means that simply blocking all characters that aren't numbers isn't 
	  * good enough because you'll also be blocking these useful and necessary keys. 
	  * You can easily detect when one of these keys is pressed. In Firefox
	  * all noncharacter keys that fire the keypress event have a character code
	  * of 0, whereas Safari versions prior to 3 give them all a character code of 8. 
	  * 
	  * In all browsers other than IE we also have to check that the key isn't ctrl 
	  * (otherwise the code would disallow copy and paste)
