  <!-- 	Forms field: common form-field methods
		
		Each form field has two methods in common: focus() and blur(). The 
		focus() method sets the browser's focus to the form field, meaning 
		the form field becomes active and will respond to keyboad events. 
		e.g. it's common to have the focus moved to the first field in a form
		when the page is loaded. The can be done by listening for the load 
		event and then calling focus on the first field
		
  --> 
		
		

  <div id="content">
	<form id="form1">
		<textarea></textarea> 
			
	</form> 

		

			
  <script type="text/javascript">
	
	EventUtil.addHandler(window, "load", function(event){
		document.forms[0].elements[0].focus(); 
	}); 
	
	/** 
	 * Note: 
	 * -----
	 * This code will cause an error if the first form field is an <input> 
	 * element with a type of "hidden" or if the field is being hidden using
	 * display or visibility CSS property
	 * 
	 * HTML5 introduces an autofocus attribute for form fields that causes 
	 * supporting browsers to automatically set the focus to that element
	 * without the use of javascript.
     * 
     * <input type="text" autofocus>

	 //to make the former code work with autofocus
	 
	 EventUtil.addHandler(window, "load", function(event){
		var element = document.forms[0].elements[0]; 
		
		if(element.autofocus !== true){
			element.focus(); console.log("JS focus"); 
		}
	}); 
	
	/** 
	 * Note: 
	 * -----
	 * the opposite of focus() is blur(). When blur() is called focus
	 * is removed from the field on which it was call
