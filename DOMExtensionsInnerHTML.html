		Markup insertion
		
		innerHTML
		
		When used in write mode, innerHTML parses the given string into a DOM 
		subtree and replaces all of the existing child nodes with it. Because the 
		string is considered to be HTML, all tags are converted into elements in 
		the standard way. 
		
		Limitations to innerHTML: 
		
		<script> elments cannot be executed when inserted via innerHTML. IE<=8 
		is the only browser that allows this but only as long as the defer attribute
		is specified and the <script> element is preceded by what Microsoft calls 
		a scoped element. The <script> element is considered a No-scope element  
		(which means that is has no visual representation on the page). IE strips 
		out all No-scope elements from the begining of strings inserted via 
		innerHTML. 
		
		Doesn't work 
		------------
		div.innerHMTL = "<script defer>console.log('hi');</script>"
		
		Works
		-----
		div.innerHMTL = _"<script defer>console.log('hi');</script>"
		div.innerHMTL = "<div> &nbsp;</div><script defer>console.log('hi');</script>
		div.innerHMTL = "<input type=\"hidden\"><script defer>console.log('hi');</script>"
		
		The first line inserts a text node (you have to go back and remove the '_'). The 
		second line uses a div with nonbreaking space (an empty div won't work, it must have 
		content and you may need to go back and remove the div). The third line uses 
		a hidden input field (doesn't affect the page layout). 
		
		Same issues with style 
		
		div.innerHTML = "<style type=\"text/css\">body {background-color:red; }</style> 
		
		In IE<=8 <style> is another No-scope element so it must be preceded by a scoped 
		element. 
		
		innerHTML is not available on all element: <col>, <colgroup>, <frameset>, <head>, 
		 										   <html>,<style>,<table>,<tbody>,<thead>, 
												   <tfoot>, and <tr> 
		
		When you're using innerHTML to insert HTML from an external source its important to 
		sanitize the HTML before passing it to innerHTML. IE8 added the window.toStaticHTML()
		method for this purpose.
