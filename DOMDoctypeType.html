  <!-- 	DcoumentType type
	
		nodeType is 10
		nodeName is the name of the doctype
		nodeValue is null
		parentNode is a Document
		Child nodes are not supported
		
		DocumentType objects cannot be created dynamically in DOM level 1. They are created
		only as the document's code is being parsed. When supported, the DocumentType object is
		stored in document.doctype. DOM level 1 describes three properties for DocumentType objects. 
		
		name: 		name of the doctype
		entities: 	NamedNodeMap of the entities described by the doctype
		notations: 	NamedNodeMap of notations described by the doctype
		
		Because browsers typically use an HTML or XHTML doctype, the entities and notations lists 
		are typically empty.The name property is the only useful and available one.
