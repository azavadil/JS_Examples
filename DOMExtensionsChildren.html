  <!-- 	HTML5: changes to the HTMLDocument
		
		children property

		The differences in how IE prior to version 9 and other browsers interpret whitespace
		in text nodes led to the creation of the children property. The children property is an 
		HTMLCollection that contains only an element's child nodes that are also elements. Otherwise, 
		the children property is the same as childNodes
