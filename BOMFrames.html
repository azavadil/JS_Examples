<!-- creates frameset with one frame across the top and two frames underneath 
	top frame can be referenced by window.frames[0] or window.frames["topFrame"]. 
	Would probably use top object (instead of window) top.frames[0] 
		
	top object always points to the top (outermost) frame (which is the browser
	window itself. 
	
	Code written within a frame references that references the window object is 
	pointing to the frame's unique instance rather than the topmost one. 
	
	Another window object is called parent. The parent object always points to 
	the current frame's immediate parent frame. Parent may be equal to top (when
	there are no frames parent is equal to top and both are equal to window)
	
	The topmost window will never have a value set for name unless the window was
	opened using window.open() -->
