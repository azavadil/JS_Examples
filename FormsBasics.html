  <!-- 	Forms
		
		Web forms are represented by the <form> element in HTML and by the HTMLFormElement type in 
		Javascript. The HTMLFormElement type inherits from HTMLElement and therefore has all of the same
		default properties as other HTML element. However HTMLFormElement also has the additional 
		properties and methods. 
		
		acceptCharset: 		the character sets that the server can process; equivalent to the HTML a
							accept-charset attribute
		action: 			the URL to send the request to; equivalent to the HTML action attribute
		elements:			an HTMLCollection of all controls in the form
		enctype:			the encoding type of the request; equivalent to the HTML enctype
		length: 			the number of controls in the form 
		method: 			the type of HTTP request to send, typically "get" or "post", equivalent
							to the HTML method attribute
		name: 				the name of the form; equivalent to the HTML name attribute
		reset(): 			Resets all form fields to their default values
		submit():			submits the form
		target:				the name of the window to use for sending the request and recieving the response, 
							equivalent to the HTML target attribute
					
		references to <form> elements can be retrieved in a number of different ways. 
		The most common way is to treat them as any other elements and assign the id attributed, 
		allowing the use of getElementById()
		
		All forms on the page can also be retrieve from document.forms collection. 
		Each form can be accessed in this collection by numeric index and by name.
