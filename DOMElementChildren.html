  <!-- 	Element children
  
		Elements may have any number of children and descendants since elements may be children 
		of elements. The childNodes property contains all the immediate children of the element 
		which may be elements, text nodes, comments, and processing instructions. 
		
		There is a significant difference between browsers regarding the identification of nodes. 
		
		IE8: 	<ul> has three child nodes (one for each <li>)
		Other: 	<ul> has seven elements (3 <li> and 4 text nodes)
		
		getElementsByTagName()
		----------------------
		get child nodes and other descendents with a particular tag name. Works exactly the 
		same as the document version except the search is rooted on the element so only descendents 
		of that element are returned
  -->
  
  
  <ul id="myList"> 
	<li>Item 1</li>
	<li>Item 2</li>
	<li>Item 3</li>
  </ul> 
  
  <script type="text/javascript">
		var ul = document.getElementById("myList"); 
		
		for (var i = 0, len=ul.childNodes.length; i < len; i++){
			if(ul.childNodes[i].nodeType == 1){
				//do processing
			}
		}
		
		/** 
		 * Note: 
		 * -----
		 * retreives all the <li> elements. Works because the <ul> element only has one 
		 * level of descendents
		 */
		var items = ul.getElementsByTagName("li"); 
		console.log(items);
