  <!-- 	HTML5 constraint validation
  
		HTML5 introduces the ability for browsers to validate data in forms
		before submiting to the server. The browser itself handles the validation
		
		The first condition is when the form field has a required attribute. Any 
		field marked as required must have a value in order for the form to be 
		submitted. This attribute applies to <input>, <textarea>, and <select> 
		fields. You can check to see if a form field is required in JavaScript
		by using the corresponding required property. 
		
		HTML5 specifies several additional values for the type attribute on an 
		<input> element. Provide additional information about the type of data
		expected and also some default validation. The two new input types are
		"email" and "url"

		There are numeric types that expect number-based input. "number", "range", 
		"datetime", "datetime-local", "date", "month", "week", "time". These are 
		not well supported. 
		
		Each of the numeric types can specify a min attribute, a max attribute, 
		and a step attribute. 
		
		Each of these attributes have a corresponding property. 
		
		stepUp(): 		
		@param1: 				the number to add to the current value
		
		stepDown(): 			
		@param1: 				the number to subtract fro the current value
		
		input.stepUp(); 
		input.stepUp(5); 
		input.stepDown(0); 
		input.stepDown(10);
