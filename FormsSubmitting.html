  <!-- 	Forms
		
		Forms are submitted when a user interacts with a submit button or an image button. 
		Submit buttons are defined using either the <input> element or the <button> element 
		with a type attribute of "submit", and image buttons are defined using the <input> 
		element with a type attribute of "image". 
		
  --> 
		
		

  <div id="content">
	<form id="form1">
	
		<!--
			if any one of these types of buttons is within a form that has a submit
			button, pressing Enter on the keyboard when a form control has focus will
			also submit the form (exception: textarea, within which Enter creates '/n')
			
			When a form is submitted in this manner, the submit event fires right before the 
			request is sent to the server. This gives you the opportunity to validate the form 
			data and decide wether to allow the form submission to occur (see <script>). 
		-->
