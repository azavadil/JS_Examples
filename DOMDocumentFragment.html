  <!-- 	DocumentFragment type
	
		nodeType is 11
		nodeName is "#document-fragment" 
		nodeValue is null
		parentNode is null
		Child nodes may be Element, ProcessingInstructions, Comment, Text, CDATASection, or EntityReference
		
		A document fragment can't be added to a document directly. Instead it acts as an accumulator
		for other nodes that may need to be added to the document. Document fragments are created using
		the document.createDocumentFragment() method. 
		
		Document fragments inherit all methods from Node and are typically used to perform DOM 
		manipulations that are to be applied to a document. If a node from thhe document is added 
		to a document fragment, that node is removed from the document tree and won't be rendered by 
		the browser. New nodes that are added to the document fragment are also not part of the 
		document tree. Contents of a document fragment can be added to the document via appendChild()
		insertBefore(). When a document fragment is passed as the argument all of the document 
		fragments child nodes are added in that spot (the fragment itself is never added)
