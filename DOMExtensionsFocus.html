  <!-- 	HTML5
  
		Focus management
		
		HTML5 adds functionality to aid with focus management in the DOM. The first
		is document.activeElement, which always contains a pointer to the DOM element
		that current has focus. An element can receive focus automatically as the page 
		is loading via user input (typically using the Tab key) or programatically 
		using the focus() method
			
		By default, document.activeElement is set to document.body when the document 
		is first loaded. Before the document is fully loaded document.activeElement 
		is null
		
		The second addition is document.hasFocus() which returns a Boolean value
		indicating if the document has focus

  <script type="text/javascript">
	 
	 var button = document.getElementById("myButton"); 
	 button.focus(); 
	 console.log(document.activeElement === button); 
	 
	 
	 
  </script>
