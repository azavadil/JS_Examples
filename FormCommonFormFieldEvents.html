  <!-- 	Forms field: common form-field events
		
		all form fields support three events in addition to mouse, 
		keyboard, mutation, and HTML events
		
		blur: 		fires when field first loses focus
		change: 	fires when the field loses focus and the value has changed
					for <input) and <textarea> elements. Also fires when the selected
					option changes for <select> element. 
		focus: 		fires when the field gets focus
		
		Both the blur and the focus events fire because of users manually changing
		the field's focus, as well as by calling the blur() and focus() methods. 
		These two events work the same way for all form fields. The change event
		fires at different times for different controls. For <input> and <textarea> 
		element, the change evennt fires when the field loses focus and the value
		has changed since the time the control got focus. For <select> elements 
		the change event fires whenever the user changes the selected option.
		
		The focus and blur events are typically used to change the user interface 
		in some way, to provide either visual cues or additional functionality. 
		The change event is typically used to validate data that was entered into 
		a field. For example, a text box that only expects numbers. the focus event
		may be used to change the background color to indicate that the field has 
		focus. The blur event can be used to remove the background color, and the 
		change event can change the background color to red if non-numeric characters
		are entered.
