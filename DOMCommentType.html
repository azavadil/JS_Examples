  <!-- 	Comment type
		
		Comment node has the following characteristics 
		
		nodeType is 8
		nodeName is "#comment"
		nodeValue is the content of the comment
		parentNode is a Document or Element
		Child nodes are not supported
		
		Comment type inherits from the same base as the Text type so it has all of the 
		same string-manipulation methods except splitText(). A comment node can be accessed 
		as a child node from it's parent
